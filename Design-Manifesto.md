## The Manipulative Power of Design

Design and manipulation often go together. Design has the power to change how we see things, which might sound bad, but it doesn't have to be. Design helps us look at things in new ways, sometimes better than they really are. While design can manipulate, it should still be easy to understand.

For example, in the future, e-shops might use virtual reality (VR) to show products. The way we shop won’t change—we’ll still choose, buy, and receive items. But how we see them might be different. VR could show items in perfect lighting with flawless textures, creating an appealing view that isn’t completely real. The function remains the same—to show us a product—but the form becomes more visually manipulative.

## The Link Between Design and Technology

Design and technology are closely connected. Philosopher Vilém Flusser said technology changes how things work, like how a lever makes lifting easier by working against gravity. So, design is partly a technical skill. We must consider technology when creating things, not just the artistic side.

Look at coffee machines. Over the years, they’ve become simpler, moving from complex buttons to easy displays. Some people think this is progress, while others may not. But what matters is that the experience and function stay the same.

## The Short-Lived Value of Design in Mass Production

Today, design value feels temporary. Flusser said creating a plastic pen costs a lot, but now it’s so cheap it’s often given away for free. Its value comes from the design or brand, not the material. Mass production and new technology have lowered the worth of many items.

Think about a glass. Whether it’s from IKEA or handmade, it’s still just a glass. Or consider jeans. Fifty years ago, jeans were a rare luxury in Czechoslovakia. Today, they’re common, and it’s the design or brand that matters most.

## Finding the Balance Between Simplicity and Depth in Design

Flusser believed design should be "artistic" enough for everyone to enjoy but not too simple. Real simplicity makes things better. In digital and print design, people like minimalism, but minimalism without purpose can feel empty. If you remove parts without thought, the design may feel incomplete.

Modern design can be simple, but to stand out, it needs some complexity. It’s not about being flashy, but about adding meaning. Eventually, we may go back to more complex designs because pure simplicity might feel too plain.
