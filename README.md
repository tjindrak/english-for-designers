In this document you can see all the assignments for the winter semester 2024 in English for Designers (AJOVT3).

## Manifesto

The first assignment was to write a manifesto about graphic design as we view it. I took inspiration from **Vilém Flusser.**

_"Just read and think, graphic design isn’t just visuals, it’s the message that shapes the world."_
