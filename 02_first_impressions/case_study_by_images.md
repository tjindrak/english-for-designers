# Polepšovna More Than Just a Graphics Project

## I learned how the world works, in both good and bad ways.
A project that I enjoyed, but also taught me a lot. 

> "Working for friends cannot be seen as working for someone "better" and must be supported by a contract."

*I often repeat this sentence to myself after the Polepšovna project. Gee, I wonder why.*


But in retrospect, I think the team was absolutely great. We built a concept that hasn't been done in Prague yet.

#### **What exactly is the Polepšovna?**


## Polepšovna – When Two Worlds Collide
> It's a place that combines amazing food and microbrews

Meals at the Polepšovna took on a completely different dimension. During the tastings I couldn't believe how it was possible to combine Czech and Asian cuisine. But at the tastings it was a really great experience and I recommend it to anyone passing by!
### A small demonstration
*Imagine mixing Czech sirloin and dim sum dumplings*

#### Czech traditional Svíčková

## Balance of graphic and construction parts
It was necessary to work hand-in-hand with the interior architects to create the graphic visuals. Therefore, after the analysis of the interior, lines began to be used as a graphic element that also functions as an orientation system.

## Seamless collaboration between designers, architects, and builders to bring ideas to life
The transformation of the interior from an old warehouse into the space we envisioned took an incredible half a year and involved dozens of people from different sectors.

## Riding the Wave of Microbreweries
As small breweries are increasingly on the rise, this is a brewpub offering a variety of beers from small breweries across the country. The primary supplier is Volt Brewery from Jablonec nad Nisou, where most of the Polepšovna team comes from.

### Offer of microbreweries
