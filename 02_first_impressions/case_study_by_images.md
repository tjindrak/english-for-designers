## When Two Worlds Collide
Meals at the Polepšovna took on a completely different dimension. During the tastings I couldn't believe how it was possible to combine Czech and Asian kucyhni. But it was an experience at the tastings and I recommend it to everyone who passes by!

## Balance of graphic and construction parts
It was necessary to work hand-in-hand with the interior architects to create the graphic visuals. Therefore, after the analysis of the interior, lines began to be used as a graphic element that also functions as an orientation system.
