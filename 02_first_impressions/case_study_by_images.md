# **Polepšovna More Than Just a Graphics Project**

---

Beer and Czech cuisine — two things that are inseparably tied to our culture. And especially the beer — liquid gold we’re justly proud of. So when the opportunity came to join a project built on these very foundations, I didn’t hesitate for a second. Because Polepšovna isn’t just another Prague pub. It’s a place where Czech classics meet Asian flair, where you can enjoy honest beer from small local breweries, and where you can stop by for a work lunch just as easily as for an evening beer with friends.

Polepšovna is a concept that brings something entirely new to the table — a space where flavors, ideas, and people come together to create a vibrant and friendly atmosphere. For me, it was more than just a graphic design project.

## Concept&Graphics

### Concept
The concept was originally created by a well-known graphic studio in collaboration with architects, so the visual identity was already defined to some extent. My role was to further develop this visual direction — both for social media and for various printed materials.

### Graphics Materials
A significant part of the process was designing a well-functioning and visually consistent menu template. Since every good pub thrives on a menu that can evolve and adapt, it was crucial to create a system that allowed for easy and quick updates. Beyond that, I worked on a wide range of printed matter, from posters and flyers to signage and promotional materials.

### Social Media
One of the key challenges was defining the visual style for Instagram. Beyond the graphic design of printed materials, I also took on the role of content creator and social media manager for Polepšovna. The majority of the content is built around photography, with a clear focus on beer — because beer is at the very heart of Polepšovna. The tone had to reflect the character of the place: bold yet friendly, a bit punk but still approachable.

### Connecting interior and graphics
I connected the visual identity with the interior by incorporating directional lines — graphic elements that also serve as navigation tools within the space. These lines became a key unifying feature, linking the printed materials, digital content, and physical environment into one consistent and recognizable style.

## Interior

While the interior design wasn’t my responsibility, it definitely deserves to be mentioned — because without the massive amount of work that went into transforming the old warehouse, there would be no Polepšovna at all. It took months of planning, building, and collaboration between designers, architects, and craftsmen to bring the space to life.

### Seamless collaboration between designers, architects, and builders to bring ideas to life
The transformation of the interior of the old warehouse into the space we envisioned took an incredible six months and involved dozens of people from different sectors. The multi-million investment paid off.

### Before&After

The interior is created in a clean industrial-punk style. Very often sheet metal, solid wood, black and white paint or, for example, jars are used to fill one wall directly in the lounge. The lighting is elegantly arranged so that it illuminates the ceiling and does not shine in the customer's eyes.

## When Two Worlds Collide
> Place that combines amazing food and microbrews

Meals at the Polepšovna took on a completely different dimension. During the tastings I couldn't believe how it was possible to combine Czech and Asian cuisine. But at the tastings it was a really great experience and I recommend it to anyone passing by!

## Riding the Wave of Microbreweries
As small breweries are increasingly on the rise, this is a brewpub offering a variety of beers from small breweries across the country. The primary supplier is Volt Brewery from Jablonec nad Nisou, where most of the Polepšovna team comes from.
