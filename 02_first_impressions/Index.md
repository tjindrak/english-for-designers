# Background & Education
I began my educational journey at the High School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering in Liberec, specializing in technical lyceum with a focus on multimedia, photography, video, web design, and web coding. Pursuing my interests further, I enrolled in two universities simultaneously: programming at the Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering (FJFI) and graphic design at the University of Creative Communication (VŠKK). Due to time constraints, I decided to focus solely on graphic design at VŠKK. I currently live in Rychnov near Jablonec nad Nisou but spend my time in Prague at the Strahov dormitory during my studies.

# Skills & Approach to Design
As a student of graphic design, I focus primarily on UI/UX design, driven by a deep passion for typography and book layout. I'm particularly interested in exploring AI in design and approach every project with a mindset that each task is a unique challenge worth tackling. Teamwork is essential to my approach—I enjoy collaborating, providing support, and bringing ideas to life collectively. I believe that with the right determination, there’s always a way to achieve any goal.

# Current Work
I work as a Social Media Specialist for Laba Group, where I combine strategy with creativity to engage audiences effectively. I also have hands-on experience in graphic design, having created visuals for the business Polepšovna in Holešovice, refining my skills in branding and design for local enterprises.

# Hobbies & Interests
Outside of design and technology, I have a profound love for both sports and music. I play several instruments, including guitar, piano, and electric guitar, and I’m always exploring new ways to engage with music. For over 14 years, I’ve practiced capoeira, a passion that complements my athletic pursuits, as I enjoy trying different sports without hesitation. My love for nature extends to outdoor activities like camping, spending time at a cottage, and getting my hands dirty with practical tasks.
