# TOPIC – Sport as a Source of Creativity and Mental Freedom
Sport has always been a vital source of energy, inspiration, and inner balance for me — it helps me clear my mind and approach creative work with more ease and perspective. I've been practicing capoeira for over 16 years, and I want to keep spreading awareness about this unique art form that blends movement, music, discipline, and freedom.
